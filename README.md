# LOCATE Sample UI

This is a sample React application designed to get you started developing custom web apps for [LOCATE Inventory](https://locateinv.com). This app can be used as a template for your UI project. For more LOCATE developer resources please visit our [developer docs page](https://developer.locateinv.com).

## Libraries

Below is a list of libraries used in this project. It's important to familiarize yourself with these libraries before getting started.

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JavaScript UI Library
- [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) - UI Component library for React based on [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- [Reach Router](https://reach.tech/router/) - UI Router for React
- [Universal Cookie](https://github.com/reactivestack/cookies/tree/master/packages/universal-cookie) - Cookie management library for React

## Getting Started

1. **Install NodeJS** - Download and install the lastest stable version of Node.js from [NodeJS.org](https://nodejs.org)
2. **Clone the Repo** - Clone or download a copy of this repository
3. **Install Dependencies** - From the repository directory run `yarn install` to install the necessary dependencies
4. **Start the Dev Server** - From the repositry directory run `yarn start` to start the development server

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
